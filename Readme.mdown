# Couchbase .NET Client Library

This is the offical .NET client library for [Couchbase Server](http://couchbase.com).

## Features:

The client currently provides support for Couchbase Server 1.8+.

* Understands both the binary and text protocols
* Highly configurable and extendable (custom configuration, serialization)
* Supports consistent hashing
* CheckAndSet operations
* Persistent connections for more speed
* SASL Authentication

## Documentation
Documentation is maintained over at [the Couchbase site](http://www.couchbase.com/documentation). A good starting point for docs about the .Net client SDK is ["Getting started with the Couchbase .Net client"](http://www.couchbase.com/communities/net/getting-started)

## Requirements
You'll need .NET Framework 3.5 or later to use the precompiled binaries.

## Distributed via NuGet
The client is [distributed via NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/CouchbaseNetClient/), and to install it, just type:

    PM> Install-Package CouchbaseNetClient

To get help started, read this introduction: ["Getting started with the Couchbase .Net client"](http://www.couchbase.com/communities/net/getting-started)

## Building the Client

Just clone your fork or the main repository:

    git clone https://<your-user-name>@github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client

then locate and build the `Couchbase.sln` solution, using Visual Studio 2010 or later. The client uses [NuGet package restore](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages), hence any missing packages will be restored during the build, but you must ensure that your machine allows package restores.

## Tests
By default the test project expects a local installation (`localhost`) of a Couchbase server. It should be configured to have a cluster user name: `"Administrator"` with password: `"password"`.

Expected buckets are:

- `"default"`
- and a `SASL` enabled bucket, named: `"authenticated"` with the password: `"secret"`.

To get the tests to run if you have a different setup then the above, just update values in the `App.config` file located in the test project `Couchbase.Tests`. E.g, lets say you have an installation running on a server alias `cb1`, then replace all `http://localhost` for `http://cb1`.

## Versioning Notes

We use the "Semantic Versioning 2.0" model described here for our versioning model: http://http://semver.org/
*All officially released binary's use the following convention: <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH> for example 1.2.9 or 1.3.0.
*We occasionally provide snapshots of mid-iteration bug fixes for validation purposes. In which case we add another number <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>.<SNAPSHOT> where <SNAPSHOT> is a number starting at 5000 (e.g. 1.3.0.5000) and incremented with each build.
*All snapshot builds are neither tested thoroughly nor supported in any way - user beware!
